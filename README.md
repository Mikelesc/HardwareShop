# HardwareShop

Useless repo of one of our proyects when we were learning .NET Core at Hiberus. Pablo (https://github.com/KevinMolain) and me made it as a way to learn ASP .NET Core. 
Probably it doens't even work properly but I remember it was a very basic e-commerce web app, with the database built on MySQL, some Bootstrap here and there, and a Doritos logo.
